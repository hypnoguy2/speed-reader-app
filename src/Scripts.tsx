through hypnosis just simply to enter trance easily and more quickly for some of 
the more advanced files that I've created.  There's pretty much nothing else to 
it, it's going to take you down, deepen you, and wake you back up.  That's all 
there is to it.  I'd suggest playing it several times until you feel comfortable 
with it like you're going under very quickly.  It's not required, it's just 
something that would probably be good.  Anyway.`;

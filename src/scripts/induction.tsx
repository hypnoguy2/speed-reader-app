This script is designed to help you enter trance. There's pretty much nothing else to 
it, it's going to take you down, deepen you, and wake you back up.  That's all 
there is to it.  I'd suggest watching it several times until you feel comfortable 
with it like you are going under very quickly.  It's not required, it's just 
something that would probably be good.  Anyway.
 
Find yourself a nice comfortable spot and start to relax.  Just start with your 
feet and let yourself relax.  Let all the tension go as you relax more and more, 
deeper and deeper, just heavy, and comfortable, and relaxed.
 
And then let the relaxation flow upwards, upwards into your calves, so heavy and 
comfortable, so completely relaxed.  Your feet and your calves just heavy and 
comfortable, heavy and comfortable, completely relaxed.
 
Then let the relaxation move upwards, upwards on into your thighs, whole leg 
relaxing more and more completely, deeper and deeper, just heavy and comfortable 
and relaxed as you listen to my voice, listen to my voice and relax.  Feel your 
whole legs lying there, relaxed and comfortable, so very heavy and relaxed.
 
Now let the relaxation move upwards, upwards into your waist.  Your waist and 
legs just heavy and comfortable, and so very relaxed.  Just listening as 
you relax more and more, deeper and deeper, more and more completely 
relaxed, so heavy and comfortable, so completely relaxed, just sinking down 
deeper and deeper, more and more comfortable as you listen to my voice and 
relax.
 
Now let the relaxation flow upwards, upwards into your stomach.  Just nice and 
comfortable, just listening to my voice as you relax more and more completely, 
deeper and deeper, more and more completely relaxed, your whole body relaxing 
further and further as you listen and obey and relax.
 
Now let your breathing begin to slow.  In... and out... in... and out... as you 
relax deeper and deeper, more and more completely, just listening as you relax 
further and further, deeper and deeper, more and more completely relaxed.
 
Feel the relaxation through your whole body as you just listen and 
relax.  So heavy and comfortable, so completely relaxed, deep and relaxed, just 
watching the screen and nothing else, as you relax further and 
further, deeper and deeper, more and more completely.
 
Now let the relaxation flow through your shoulders and down your arms, let them 
get heavier and heavier, more and more comfortable and relaxed, feel the 
relaxation moving, moving downwards, downwards into your hands, your arms and 
hands just completely relaxed and heavy, as you listen and relax, so 
heavy and comfortable, so completely relaxed, your whole body relaxed and 
comfortable, just listening to my voice and nothing more, as you relax further 
and further, deeper and deeper, more and more relaxed.
 
Now feel the relaxation again move upwards, up your neck and into your face.  
Let your face relax as your whole body relaxes more and more completely, 
allowing yourself to sink deeper and deeper, deeper and more relaxed, just let 
yourself drift downwards now, down into a deep, comfortable trance.

Now it's time to bring you back up.  I'm going to count to 5, you'll be 
refreshed and awake, happy and comfortable and awake.
 
1, waking up more and more completely.
 
2, coming up further and further.
 
3, waking up more and more, refreshed and awake.
 
4, almost there, almost totally awake.
 
5, you are awake now, feeling refreshed and happy.  Hopefully you enjoyed your 
experience and will watch again.`;
